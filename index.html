			Hello, I am mehmet kızıltaş Inönü University computer engineering department graduate.
			I graduated from the University in December 2020.
			I have been involved in many school projects throughout my education life.
			We did most projects as groups.
			As a team of 6 people for the internet programming course project, we made basic classroom
			automation using JSF (Java Server Faces). In the project, we used HeidiSQL as the database 
			management system, I encoded the connections between HTML pages and the database with JAVA 
			during the project development phase. In the Object Oriented Programming course, I made a 
			desktop program (Form Application) myself using C #. I made parallel and serial coding of 
			Radix Sort algorithm using C language and OpenMP in distributed systems and parallel programming 
			course. I love making JAVA and C # applications.I myself am a person who is fond of freedom and 
			does not like being too restricted, and another feature of me is that if I study or become interested
			in a subject, I try to be the best in that subject.
