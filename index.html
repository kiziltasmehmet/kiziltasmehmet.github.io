			Hello, I am mehmet kızıltaş Inönü University computer engineering department graduate.
			I graduated from the University in December 2020.
			I have been involved in many school projects throughout my education life.
			We did most projects as groups.
			In one project, we encoded class automation with JSF (Java Server Faces) and used 
			heidisql as a database management system, in this project, I encoded the connections
			established between the html page and the database using the java programming language.
